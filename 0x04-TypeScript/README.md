## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you should be able to:

- Explain basic types in TypeScript.
- Understand how to use interfaces, classes, and functions effectively.
- Demonstrate proficiency in working with the DOM using TypeScript.
- Implement generic types for reusable code.
- Utilize namespaces for organizing code.
- Merge declarations effectively.
- Import external libraries using ambient namespaces.
- Implement basic nominal typing concepts.
